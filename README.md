# Fleeting notes

üìù In general, "fleeting notes" can refer to short, temporary or transient pieces of information or thoughts that are quickly recorded for future reference. They are often used to capture ideas, reminders, or snippets of information that may be relevant at a later time. Fleeting notes are typically concise and may not be organized in a structured manner like a formal document or article.

üöÄ This project aims to help me practice with NextJs, Supabase and React. It allows users to quickly jot down their thoughts, ideas, and reminders, and easily access them whenever needed. With a simple and intuitive interface, users can create, edit, and delete their notes effortlessly.
